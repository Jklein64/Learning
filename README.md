# Learning

_VCV rack modules created to learn the plugin API_

The Blank module is from the [GenericBlank](https://github.com/Paul-Dempsey/GenericBlank) template repo.

## Building

For local plugin development, clone this repository into the plugins folder of the local [Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) source tree. Run `make dist` from the root of this repo, and then run `make run` from the root of the Rack source tree. That will open a local VCVRack instance in developer mode with this plugin installed.

See the [VCVRack docs](https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial) for more details.
